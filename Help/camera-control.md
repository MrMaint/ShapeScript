Camera Control
---

When you open a file in ShapeScript, it is rendered in 3D using a virtual camera, which can be controlled via a mouse or trackpad. The camera is not part of the file itself, and moving it will not change the file in any way.

By default, the camera is positioned along the Z axis, looking down at the model. The distance of the camera from the origin is set automatically based on the bounding sphere of the model.

To reset the camera to its default position, select the `View > Reset Camera` menu, or press **Cmd-0** on the keyboard.

## Mouse Control

**Note:** The instructions below assume the use of an Apple Magic Mouse. Controls for other mice may differ.
